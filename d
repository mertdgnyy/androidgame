    Game over screen implemented with a new clase named GameOver that consists of game score and replay button if user wants to play the game again, a new line added users to limit their shooting area, a few bugs about bitmap collapsions were fixed. new styles added to the themes.xml folder for making the gameover screen functional like making it FullScreen etc. New task will be changing the gif, background, and button images for making game visually better that will take some time

    Math conditions added into the onDraw method. Now, if user started to drag the aimer, aimer can be drawn, also if user drags from left side to the right, or the opposite, by taking abs of the coordinates, simply if they are greater than 0, aimer also can be drawn. In addition, the item coming from the aimer was implemented in a one direction. When touch event stops, each variable values set to 0 for producing bitmaps again. There are still some bugs that I am trying to fix, I belive that they happened because of the usage of temporary png pictures like book and aimer images because of their sizes with x and y coordinates. They will be fixed eventually with the picture adjustments .

    now, bitmaps can go the the most left side of the screen according to the their speeds and if they reach the left side according to their width which I take this value from tWidth() method that I created previously, their positions reset and starts from the right side of the screen again.

    New arraylist implemented for using more than 1 different bitmap-gifs. A for loop implemented in GameScreen to pass the context by adding objects in a list. Also in onDraw in GameScreen, instead of using old drawBitmap implementation, new one was implemented with for loop because my plan is to implement more than one bits now, and I put an if condition to control gif animation. After reaching the desired frame variable, it will reset itself.
